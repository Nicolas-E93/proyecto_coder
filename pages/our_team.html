                        Nicolas Escobar and Daniel Tovar - Founders<br>
                        United by a deep-rooted passion for chess and a lifelong friendship, we embarked on this journey
                        to
                        create a
                        platform that celebrates our shared love for the game. Hailing from Colombia, our dream was to
                        establish
                        a
                        hub that brings together chess players from all walks of life. With determination and
                        creativity, we
                        laid
                        the foundation for this global chess haven.
